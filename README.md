## ModuTherm Wafer Test System  
The ModuTherm Wafer Test System is designed to support the testing of 2-inch (50.8 mm) diameter silica/quartz wafers within a testing chamber. This system includes three main components: a Thermal Regulation System, a Temperature Stabilization Probe, and a Probe Card. These components are designed for easy replacement or modification to accommodate various testing needs.

The design focuses on providing a customizable and user-friendly experience, allowing for adjustments to suit specific testing requirements. The modular nature of the system aims to facilitate the testing process for custom silica/quartz wafers, catering to the needs of researchers and professionals looking for a functional and adaptable testing solution.

The **Copper Temperature Stabilization Probe** is designed with a contact diameter of 1.685 inches (42.8 mm), ensuring adequate contact within the central region of a wafer substrate. The contact point is elevated by approximately 0.063 inches (1.6 mm) to ensure that a PCB probe card, detailed later in the documentation, aligns perfectly flush with the surface. Users have the flexibility to select a thermal paste that best suits their requirements to enhance surface contact between the probe and the wafer.

For a comprehensive understanding of the design, a preliminary drawing is available in the preceding image. Additionally, for detailed examination and utilization, a PDF of the drawing, along with STL and STEP files, are provided in the folder named "1. Copper Temperature Stabilization Probe" within this repository.
