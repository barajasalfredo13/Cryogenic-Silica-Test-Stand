# ModuTherm Wafer Test System

This hardware has been engineered to provide a modular and streamlined approach for testing custom silica/quartz wafers with a diameter of 2 inches (50.8 mm). It is comprised of three main components: a steel temperature controller, a copper temperature finger, and a PCB substrate holder. The design of each component facilitates easy replacement or modification of the temperature finger and the PCB substrate holder, ensuring adaptability to various testing requirements.

The instrumentation's design emphasizes customization and ease of use, allowing users to seamlessly tailor the hardware to their specific testing requirements. The modular design not only increases the flexibility of the system but also simplifies the process for testing custom silica/quartz wafers, making it an ideal solution for researchers and professionals seeking precision and adaptability.
