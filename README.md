## ModuTherm Wafer Test System  
The ModuTherm Wafer Test System is designed to support the testing of 2-inch (50.8 mm) diameter silica/quartz wafers within a testing chamber. This system includes three main components: a Thermal Regulation System, a Temperature Stabilization Probe, and a Probe Card. These components are designed for easy replacement or modification to accommodate various testing needs.

The design focuses on providing a customizable and user-friendly experience, allowing for adjustments to suit specific testing requirements. The modular nature of the system aims to facilitate the testing process for custom silica/quartz wafers, catering to the needs of researchers and professionals looking for a functional and adaptable testing solution.
